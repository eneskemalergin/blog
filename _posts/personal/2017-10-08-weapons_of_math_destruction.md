[Weapons of Math Destruction](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28186015-weapons-of-math-destruction) is a book by [Cathy O'Neil](https://twitter.com/mathbabedotorg) (also the author of the blog called [mathbabe](https://mathbabe.org/)) which I can define in 4 words: captivating, haunting, honest, and enlightening.

## Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy

I've found myself reading books about technology more than ever. Starting with [The Second Machine Age](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17986396-the-second-machine-age), [Weapons of Math Destruction](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28186015-weapons-of-math-destruction), and currently reading [Machine, Platform, Crowd](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32606599-machine-platform-crowd), they are the ones that I've finished any many more is in my to read list. But why am I interested in reading these? Answer is really simple, because I want to know what are the larger scale effects of the technologies that I am using, developing in daily basis. These concepts are not taught in the class or practiced in any project. __We as developers or as users, should be aware of the effects of the technology to come up with better solutions, policies, and bridges to connect user and application.__

The book [Weapons of Math Destruction](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28186015-weapons-of-math-destruction) is a little different than other books that I am reading, in terms of its tone. __The tone of the author is more warning and notice of the mathematical algorithms, and their chaotic effects on the large scale than the overview of new emerging technologies.__ One can see the darker tone in the book, and cannot take him/herself from thinking that how math and computer science is in everything and changing our life in a way that needs regulation. It needs regulation because the systems they are using is feeding a negative feedback to the system which creates inequality in a greater scale every time its being put to use.

The author touches so many ethical dilemmas created by these WMDs [(__W__)eapons of (__M__)ath (__D__)estruction)] and gives reader a space to think about them. __The reason that WMDs are creating ethical dilemmas is that they penalize the poor, the ethnically diverse, or simply the non-target audience of the profit WMDs.__


As a developer of Machine Learning technologies, I use math, statistics, and big data quite a lot. And learning that intentionally or un-intentionally misusing those methods could result in catastrophic effects in the large scale. That's why the points I get from this book is really important for me. By reverse engineering the WMDs, I get what I should be doing and be more careful to.
