## Introduction
Our world revolve around the Sun, or more technically speaking all objects with mass which has magnetic link to sun revolves around the mass in the center of our solar system. And for our planet, one full revolution around this mass is approximately 365 days. Today is the 364th day, and it's the time of the year for my personal re-assessment.  

What I always been doing is planning my whole year, but it was never been writing every detail and predicting what future is holding for me, instead I was planning to draw the frame of the bigger picture. Something like this:

I have been hearing about the new year's resolutions from people around me. I never actually tried setting goals under the label of new year's resolutions, because the same people also demonstrate that they set some unachievable goals to themselves and they mock how these things are junk. I am not saying that new year's resolutions are garbage, in fact I am saying setting goals carried me where I am now. But the term "new year's resolution" does not revoke good things, always failures and regrets, because of feeds and posts like these:

New year is actually a great time to change somethings in our life. It is better to start from beginning, and when is better than the beginning of a new year. Constantly mocking about the new year's resolution is making it really hard for me to go under this label but this year I will do it. I will do this __New Year's Resolution__ thing, and I will prove that it is not that the term is cursed but the people are not taking these changes seriously.

I will take the concept and go even further, by setting goals which will help me improve my personality, such as 'listening others' ideas more' or 'less giving in to my brain or my heart in terms of control.' These resolutions are more abstract then losing weight or eating healthy, but they are more effective and beneficial in future.


As always, I believe _"first, target the problem to solve a solution"_ approach. In this situation the solution is given, I need to find the problem. __What are the weaknesses that I need to improve?__ The moment this thought dropped into my mind, I got some problems I wanted solve about myself, such as my focus issue, and velleity of things which goes fast. But after thinking deeper I realized these are caused by my not my main personality, but the personality that I am imposing myself. Then I realized that to find a problem I need to go deeper and find another problem which results the first problem I was trying to find. __This is puzzling, I know.__ Next problem I need to address comes from a maybe one of the most popular questions __"Who Really I am?"__

In a society that enforcing us to engrave ourselves to the several stereotypes. People who refuses to fit into these stereotypes are criticised consciously or unconsciously. To blend in to this society we are changing ourselves from what really makes us unique. Now I understand why answering this question is really hard: __"What makes you unique and special?"__  We don't really know who we are, because we are trying to be someone else, a model, a singer, a billionaire, or a hippie. :)

## Who am I?

![Who Am I? ](http://energeticawakenings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/who-am-i-5.png)

It was a painful one week period journey through my heart's deepest corners to find some answers. From the far end of my heart to the summit of my brain, I was looking for the real me. I had tons of answers but when I asked my heart I saw they are not projecting the real Enes, instead they were the the puppets played by me to protect myself from others. It was the first thing I realized about myself. I am very __secretive and mistrustful__ about my own identity. I cannot trust people easily, and I think I never opened myself fully to anyone, even to my mom or my sister. This could be one of my weakness or a defense mechanism, I am not really sure.

I am driven by the __sense of idealism and morality__, which helps me focus what I am really supposed to do, __helping others__.

![Helping Others](http://quotescloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/A-person-has-two-hands-One-for-helping-himself-the-other-for-helping-others.jpg)

Unintentionally I always follow a path that I can help people most. This _"Help"_ sometimes in a form of teaching what I know in return of nothing, mentoring, and even following a dream to be a scientist. But now I realize that what I was trying to do was helping others. I worked almost 3 years volunterly as a teaching assistant, mentor, tutor in my school and in my organization called Scholar Development Center. People always criticized and mocked me -_at least that's how I felt_- because I was working for free even when I didn't really have money. Whatever people say about it I always feel good when I am helping other people. 2 years ago I prepared a Python Programming class in my school to teach everyone who wants to learn programming. 35 people took the class and one of them taught Python next year to girls. I felt really good and proud.

I think I can say that, __my main purpose is helping people in need in as many ways as possible__, but I prefer to find the heart of the problem which causes people need help and solve that problem. That's why I am following an academia path in biomedical research, so I can solve bigger problem which causes trouble to thousands of people.

__I am good-tempered and accommodating person__. I try to listen and understand other side as much as possible but I am not really master at this. I have __strong opinions and I would fight endlessly for an idea I believe in__.

__I am decisive and strong-willed__, If I decided to do something, I would do it as fast as possible. That's where the problem occurs, __my attention to what I wanted to do changes really fast,__ so if I could not finish the first thing I started to do before the second thing, it is not hard for me to replace them and left first thing unfinished.  

__Creativity, imagination, conviction, and sensitivity are my main tools when I solve problems__. In a result of this weird set of tools I follow a path that not everyone follows, or I create my own paths and pioneer the following parties whom will follow the path I created. Since I am really good at opening new paths and leading people through these paths, __it makes me vulnerable to arrogancy and egocentricity.__

__I have an unaccustomed way of understanding personalities__, that's why I can engage in conversation really good, and a good first impressions. I think that's why people think that I am an extraverted person, although I am not. __I am introvert who can socialize well because of my understanding of others, but I still need alone time with myself or someone I am totally opened myself.__

__I take great care of other's feelings, and I expect the same in return.__ From very early ages, I have been hurt a lot because of this caring others. I take this personality of mine as a vulnerability, that's why __I avoid people, and I cannot trust them easily.__
