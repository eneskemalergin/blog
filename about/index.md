Hello there! I'm a bioinformatics scientist who uses the power of computers and artificial intelligence to find esoteric solutions to problems in the field of biology. Currently, I'm pursuing a Ph.D. in Bioinformatics at the University of British Columbia, Canada, and working on cancer proteomics at the Lange Lab at BC Children's Hospital Research Center.

Biology and computer science are two of my biggest passions, which is why I decided to pursue a career in bioinformatics. I mostly write about what I'm currently interested in, which is why you'll find a variety of topics on my blog. If you're looking for something specific, check out the tags tab.

Although my blog started out as a purely technical one, I decided to include some other domains as well, such as book summaries and language learning articles. If you're interested, you can [click here to download my CV](https://github.com/eneskemalergin/My_CV/raw/master/Academic_CV.pdf).

I hope you have fun reading my blog!
