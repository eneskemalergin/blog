# CSV files
CSV is a comma seperated value file for storing the data. Let's assume that we have one it will look like this:
```Title,Released,Label,UK Chart Position,US Chart Position,BPI Certification,RIAA Certification ``` This is the first line of the csv file which represents the variables or fields. Following lines are the rows of csv which contains the data labeled same order as the first line ```Beatles for Sale,4 December 1964,Parlophone(UK),1,â€”,Gold,Platinum```

CSV is widely used because of its easy syntax for instance; each line of text is contains a single row, fields are seperated by comma delimiter, it contains only data itself, doesn't need special software to open up. The best thing about csv files are all spreedsheet apps can read and write the CSV file.

## Parsing CSV file with Python
We will create a Python dictionary from data from CSV file. Parsing data into python from csv is very useful because, most of the time data is so huge to run from csv directly and we can filter out the data according to our needs with Python.

```Python
import os

directory = " "
datafile = "beatles-diskography.csv"

def parse_file(datafile):
	dat = []
	with open(dat, 'rb') as f:
		label = f.readline().split(",")
		c = 0
		for line in f:
			if counter == 10:
				break

			# Assing a list with line in each iteration
			fields = line.split(",")
			# Creates an empty dictionary
			datadict = {}
			#
			for i, value in enumerate(fields):
				datadict[label[i].strip()] = value.strip()

			dat.append(datadict)
			counter += 1
	return dat

def test():
	dfile = os.path.join(directory, datafile)
	d = parse_file(dfile)

	# Checking if the algoritms work.
	firstline = {'Title': 'Please Please Me', 'UK Chart Position': '1', 'Label': 'Parlophone(UK)', 'Released': '22 March 1963', 'US Chart Position': '-', 'RIAA Certification': 'Platinum', 'BPI Certification': 'Gold'}
	tenthline = {'Title': '', 'UK Chart Position': '1', 'Label': 'Parlophone(UK)', 'Released': '10 July 1964', 'US Chart Position': '-', 'RIAA Certification': '', 'BPI Certification': 'Gold'}
	assert d[0] == firstline
	assert d[9] == tenthline

test()
```

> Sometimes you may get variables more than you expected, it's because in one value there is a comma to seperate users answer. In those cases we need look at the data carefully and write some more lines to avoid such issues.

### How to solve the issue above?
If we have a comma inside the value in comma seperated value file, it will confuse the interpreter. But most of the time they avoid such casualties with putting quotes around multiple variables to make it straigth for interpreter. The first algorithm would not work completely but we can change that. What it quotes tells us we can ignore the delimiter inside the quotes. Then another issue may occur, if database used single quotes to avoid issues comes from usage of multiple variables with comma in one field, some data will be mixed up because single quote can be used as brace for special names, or any other usage.

Python has a module called csv to deal with all those problems. You may write algorithms by yourself to avoid such situations but using module is easier. Here is the example usage of csv does the same job as the first algorithm we wrote.

```Python
# Calling the related libraries
import os
import csv
import pprint
# defining variables to define directory and file that we use
directory = " "
datafile = "beatles-diskography.csv"

# parse the file using csv module
def parse_csv(datafile):
	# Creates an empty list
	data = []

	# Opens the file for reading
	with open(datafile, 'rb') as sd:
		# Reads all the date into dictionaries
		# it also assumes the first row as a header in default.
		r = csv.DictReader(sd)

		# Go over the lines and append them into data list
		for line in r:
			data.append(line)
	return data

# For running the code in terminal
if __name__ == "__main__":
	dfile = os.path.join(directory, datafile)
	d = parse_csv(dfile)
	pprint.pprint(d)
```
