## XLRD module for xls
xlrd module allows us to work with excel file, file with .xls extensions or similar(.xlsx). Let's go deep into this module and learn it from sample code:

```Python
# We call the xlrd module: excel module for python
import xlrd

# Here is our data with old excel format(new ones have .xlsx)
datafile = "2013_ERCOT_Hourly_Load_Data.xls"


def parse_file(datafile):
    # Opens the data file with xlrd and store it into variable called workbook
    workbook = xlrd.open_workbook(datafile)
    # Specifies which sheet to work, in this case the first one in excel
    sheet = workbook.sheet_by_index(0)

    # list comprehension: Reads all the data into python list called data.
    data = [[sheet.cell_value(r, col) # gets the rth and colth value when we loop through
                for col in range(sheet.ncols)]
                    for r in range(sheet.nrows)]


    print "\nList Comprehension"
    print "data[3][2]:",
    print data[3][2] # Prints the value in 3rd row and 2nd column


    print "\nCells in a nested loop:"
    for row in range(sheet.nrows):
        for col in range(sheet.ncols):
            if row == 50:
                print sheet.cell_value(row, col), # Prints the entire row when rown number equals to 50


    ### other useful methods:
    print "\nROWS, COLUMNS, and CELLS:"
    print "Number of rows in the sheet:",
    print sheet.nrows
    print "Type of data in cell (row 3, col 2):",
    print sheet.cell_type(3, 2)
    print "Value in cell (row 3, col 2):",
    print sheet.cell_value(3, 2)
    print "Get a slice of values in column 3, from rows 1-3:"
    print sheet.col_values(3, start_rowx=1, end_rowx=4)

    print "\nDATES:"
    print "Type of data in cell (row 1, col 0):",
    print sheet.cell_type(1, 0)
    exceltime = sheet.cell_value(1, 0)
    print "Time in Excel format:",
    print exceltime
    print "Convert time to a Python datetime tuple, from the Excel float:",
    print xlrd.xldate_as_tuple(exceltime, 0)

    return data

data = parse_file(datafile)

```
