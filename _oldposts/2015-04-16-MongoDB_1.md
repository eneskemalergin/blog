> What is data wrangling ?

Data Wrangling is set of jobs processed on data; getting, extracting, cleaning and storing the data. Data Scientists are spending %70 percent of their time on data wrangling.

Data wrangling is all about getting the data ready for analyzing.

> Quality of Data?
Which data should we use or in what type we need to get the data? Most of the time, when humans are involved in a situation, that situation is error prone. How do you avoid these?

We need to be careful about our data. Sometimes data needs careful look. For example in date data, we might get day/month/year, or month/day/year or 4 more other cases. So if you examine your data carefully you will catch more error, and get healthier results.

We need to assess our data to :

* Test assumptions about
	* Values
	* Data Types
	* Shape
* Identify errors or outliers
* Find missing values
* (Also the type of data must be appropriate to the database that we want to use)

In tabular data we get variables which are the values of columns and observations which are the rows. Most of the time the first row is for label to specifiy the variable names. Or in other meaning, Columns are fields and rows are items. Which definition you like most you can go with it or you can make up some if you wish.
