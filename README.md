# "The Blog"

This is my blog part of my personal website. I am sharing about everything that I care and think about; technical, personal development, language learning, and book summary posts. I hope to help people with the things I write about.

## Survival for Bioinformatics Series
This is a larger scale project that I want to complete. In this large series of blog-post series I aim to tackle the most important and must known concepts in Bioinformatics from it's main domains like Stats, Math, CS, and Biology. I will be posting here the curriculum-like outline and it will be the ultimate blog-post series. ;) My goal is to help people who have trouble adapting to the world of bioinformatics by delivering a concise, concrete, pellucid, and fun content, which they can read and learn faster than searching on the internet and spending hours reading books and papers.
